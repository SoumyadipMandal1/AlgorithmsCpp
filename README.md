## Algorithms in C++

I am trying to make all the algorithms in C++ in this Github repository.
I had written some algorithms.

It would be helpful if someone

- Finds bugs
- Finding optimizations 
- Advices to make the code more readable by adding comments, docstrings or changing variable
- Giving suggestions on making more algorithmic projects

I want to make this repository 100 % in C++.
